# Master Thesis

Hello! This is the repository on where I'm storing the stuff I develop/gather for my Master Thesis at ETH ZÃ¼rich. The topic of the thesis is "Designing physical experiments using Neural Networks". 

## Content

- In the folder "Models" you can find links to the Colab Jupyter notebooks I use to experiment with the models.
- In the folder "To generate the datasets" you can find the datasets and the files to generate them.
- In the folder "Arcade" I have stored some experiments with the "Arcade" library to represent the movement and simulate the dinamics of the colission at all times.
